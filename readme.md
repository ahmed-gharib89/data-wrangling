# Data Wrangling

### Introduction
This repo is a part of Data Wrangling course in [udacity](https://udacity.com) Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree

### Lesson one (Introduction to data wrangling)
1- Gathering Data
* downloading a file from the internet, which in this case was a zip file from Kaggle,
* opening a Jupyter Notebook,
* unzipping the zip file using Python,
* then importing the extracted CSV file into a pandas DataFrame in the Jupyter Notebook.

2- Assessing Data
So far we identified the following issues in the data:
* Nondescriptive column headers
* Missing values (i.e. NaNs)
* Inconsistent representations of values, specifically "As soon as possible" and other similar values to "ASAP" in the StartDate column for this dataset
* A messy (i.e. untidy) dataset
